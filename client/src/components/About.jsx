                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        Apex Card Limited was set up in 1997 to finance infrastructure, focusing primarily on project finance and mobilization of capital for private sector infrastructure development. Whether it is financial intermediation for infrastructure projects and services, or adding value through innovative products to the infrastructure value chain or asset maintenance of existing infrastructure projects, the company focused on supporting organizations to get the best credit cards.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                        The Companyâ€™s ability to tap global as well as Indian financial resources made it the acknowledged experts in infrastructure finance. Dr. Kanhaiya Lal joined the company in 2005 and successfully expanded the business to Asset Management, Institutional Broking, and Infrastructure Debt Fund. He applied for a commercial banking license to the RBI in 2013. In 2014, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) granted an in-principle approval to Apex Card Limited to set up a new bank in the private sector.

                        Following this, the Apex Card Limited divested its infrastructure finance assets and liabilities to a new entity - Apex Card Bank - through demerger. Thus, Apex Card Bank was created by demerger of the infrastructure, lending business of Apex Card to Apex Card Bank in 2015.
